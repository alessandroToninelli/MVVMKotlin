#### ***UPDATE
I have update project with PagingLibrary with RxJava to load the posts gradually


# MVVMKotlin
MVVM design pattern fo android write with kotlin

### Functionality 
This is a simple app that load posts and related users, write in **Kotlin**.

The application implement the MVVM design pattern. For Business Logic I used RxJava and for the development of the Ui LiveData.
Then the ViewModel communicates with the Respository via rxJava, between UI and ViewModel with LiveData.


#### Architecture Components used

* Dagger
* Navigation
* Lifecycle
* RxJava
* LiveData
* Retrofit
* DataBinding
* PagingLibrary
  
  
Now there is no data saving on Room, it will soon be introduced with the Clean Architecture

 I will constantly update the project to include new features and architectures.
